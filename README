README
------

This is the README file for for the CS106A project.

This project contains solutions to the class CS106A Programming 
Methodology given at Stanford starting January 2012.

See http://cs106a.stanford.edu for details on how to setup and 
run Stanford's JAVA-based Karel the Robot with Eclipse.

This project is meant to track my progress with the course assignments as 
I follow the course on-line.
